This talk is based on a multi-year ethnographic study of algorithmic software agents in Wikipedia, where bots and automated tools have fundamentally transformed the nature of the notoriously decentralized, ‘anyone can edit’ encyclopedia project. I studied how the development and operation of automated software agents intersected with the development of organizational structures and epistemic norms. My ethnography of infrastructure (Star, 1999) involved participant-observation in various spaces of Wikipedia. I have both conducted routine editorial activity in Wikipedia (which is heavily algorithmically assisted) for over 10 years, and I specifically worked in Wikipedian bot development, including proposing, developing, and operating a bot of my own, as well as helping other bot and tool developers redesign their bots and tools. I also conducted extensive archival analyses of bots in the history of Wikipedia.
